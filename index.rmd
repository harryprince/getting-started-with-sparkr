# Getting Started with SparkR for Big Data Analysis

R is a popular statistical programming language for performing efficient data manipulation, visualization and machine learning tasks. However, interactive data analysis in R is usually limited as the runtime is single-threaded and can only process data sets that fit in a single machine’s memory.  SparkR provides an R frontend to Apache Spark and using Spark’s distributed computation engine allows R-users to run large scale data analysis from the R shell.
