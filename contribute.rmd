# Contributing

This book is being developed in the open, and I highly encourage you to contribute to make it better. You can contribute in one or more ways:

* If you find a typographical error, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull 
  request using the following steps: 
  
    * Click the "edit this page" button on the sidebar
  
    * Make the changes using github's in-page editor and save.
    
    * Submit a pull request including a brief description of your changes e.g. "fixed typo" 
      
    * If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the 
      copyright of this contribution to Daniel Emaasit" - I need this so I can 
      publish the printed book.  
      
* If you have any suggestions, comments, or there's something confusing in the book, please [contact me](mailto:daniel.emaasit@gmail.com).
