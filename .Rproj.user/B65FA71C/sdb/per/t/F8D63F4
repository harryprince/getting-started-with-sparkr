However, interactive data analysis in R is usually limited as the runtime is single-threaded and can only process data sets that fit in a single machine’s memory.  SparkR provides an R frontend to Apache Spark and using Spark’s distributed computation engine allows R-users to run large scale data analysis from the R shell.\n\n<ul class=\"toc\">\n  {% include book-nav.html %}\n</ul>\n\n",
